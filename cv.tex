    \section{Summary}
        \vspace*{-0.2cm}
        I am a backend software engineer with a MSc in Computer Science and 6 years of\\experience working on a SaaS online banking platform, which serves tens of millions of end users.
        My exposure to large systems and solutions to tame their complexity has taught me the importance of producing performant, scalable, and maintainable code.\\
        I value collaboration and teamwork over individual contributions, although I am comfortable working independently.
        At NCR Edinburgh, I also came to lead the recruitment team, having interviewed over 100 candidates and hired a dozen of them.\\
        Moreover, I have organised the office hackathons twice a year for the past 4 years.

            {\emph{Scala - Typelevel stack (cats, cats effect, http4s, fs2), Kafka; Java, React}
            \vspace*{0.05cm}\\
            Developed new microservices, written in purely functional Scala, both adding new RESTful APIs and replacing part of the legacy backend.\\
            The new code proved to be significantly more performant due to its parallel architecture, and more reliable by making use of retry mechanisms.\\
            Maintained the existing marketing tool, which is a Java/Spring web application with a JS/React frontend.\\
            Analysed and tweaked the performance of the hot path of the application flow, reducing timeouts by an order of magnitude.\\
            Started a new cloud-based marketing product, hosted on GCP.}

            {\emph{Java, Spring Boot}
            \vspace*{0.05cm}\\
            Designed and implemented a new single sign-on platform using Spring Boot, to support novel integration mechanisms. This lead to new clients, and had the long-term goal of replacing the previous middleware.}

            \vspace*{0.05cm}\\
            Migrated the codebase from Java 6 on JBoss 5 to Java 8 on Tomcat 8.\\
            Reverse engineered a legacy C++/CGI service and integrated it in the main product. This allowed the company to decommission a datacentre, saving millions of dollars a year.\\
            Wrote tools to assist the migration, and mentored the team's QA engineer.}
