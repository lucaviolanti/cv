# About

My curriculum vitae.

## Usage

Run `make` to create the PDF (`cv.pdf`).

This template needs the following dependencies installed:

* TikZ (header)
* XeTex and fontspec (custom fonts)
* textpos (aside)

## Options

* `print`: renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light
* `nocolors`: no colors in section headers (but still use dark header)

## License

Based on a fork of the ShareLateX version of the [Friggeri CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv) from Adrien Friggeri changed to render in A4 paper format.
